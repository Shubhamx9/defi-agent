# Security Policy 🛡️

This document outlines the security measures, policies, and procedures for the DeFi AI Assistant project.

## 🔒 Security Overview

The DeFi AI Assistant implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect user data, prevent abuse, and ensure safe operation in production environments.

### Security Principles
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Zero Trust**: Verify everything, trust nothing
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for all components
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Input Validation & Sanitization
```python
# Implemented protections:
- Query length validation (max 1000 characters)
- Prompt injection detection and prevention
- Suspicious pattern filtering
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Command injection prevention
```

### Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention
```python
# Multi-tier rate limiting:
- 60 requests per minute per IP
- 1000 requests per hour per IP
- Session-based rate limiting
- Adaptive rate limiting based on behavior
- IP-based blocking for abuse patterns
```

### Session Security
```python
# Secure session management:
- Cryptographically secure UUID generation
- Session expiration (5 minutes default)
- IP address tracking and validation
- Session invalidation on suspicious activity
- Secure session storage in Redis
```

### API Security
```python
# API protection measures:
- CORS configuration with allowed origins
- Request size limits
- Timeout protection
- Error message sanitization
- Request ID tracking for audit trails
```

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Current Implementation
- **Session-based authentication** with secure UUID tokens
- **IP-based validation** for session consistency
- **Rate limiting** as primary abuse prevention mechanism

### Recommended Enhancements for Production
```python
# JWT-based authentication
from fastapi_users import FastAPIUsers
from fastapi_users.authentication import JWTAuthentication

# OAuth2 integration
from authlib.integrations.fastapi_oauth2 import OAuth2Token

# API key management
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer, HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
```

## 🔍 Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling
```python
# Data classification:
SENSITIVE_DATA = [
    "api_keys",           # Never logged
    "user_queries",       # Logged with sanitization
    "session_tokens",     # Hashed in logs
    "ip_addresses",       # Masked in logs
    "wallet_addresses"    # Anonymized in logs
]
```

### Logging Security
```python
# Secure logging practices:
- No API keys or secrets in logs
- PII anonymization
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Log rotation and retention policies
- Secure log storage and access controls
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required security configurations:
DEBUG=false                    # Never true in production
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=["https://yourdomain.com"]
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60
RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR=1000
SESSION_TTL=300               # 5 minutes
MAX_QUERY_LENGTH=1000
```

## 🚨 Vulnerability Management

### Security Scanning
```bash
# Dependency scanning
pip-audit

# Code security analysis
bandit -r backend/

# Container scanning
docker scan your-image:tag

# Infrastructure scanning
checkov -f docker-compose.yml
```

### Known Security Considerations

#### AI Model Security
- **Prompt Injection**: Implemented detection and filtering
- **Model Poisoning**: Using trusted model providers (OpenAI, Google)
- **Data Leakage**: No training data exposure in responses
- **Adversarial Inputs**: Input validation and sanitization

#### API Security
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting and request size limits
- **Injection Attacks**: Input sanitization and validation
- **CORS Misconfiguration**: Strict origin validation
- **Information Disclosure**: Error message sanitization

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Container Security**: Non-root user, minimal base images
- **Network Security**: Proper firewall rules and network segmentation
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables, not hardcoded
- **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege

RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser
USER appuser

# Security scanning
